# Pour Decisions

This is an assignment I did for school, the objective was to create a Cocktail wiki type web app.

We were tasked with using [The Cocktail DB's](https://www.thecocktaildb.com) API to make an app.

## Objectives for G (_Pass_)

### Randomizer

- Fetch a random drink, both on site load and with the press of a button.
- The Cocktail name and picture should be visible.
- You should be able to go to the drinks detail page from this page.

### Details Page

- Category
- Picture
- Tags
- Instructions
- Ingredients and measures
- Glass type

### Search page

- Search by name
- Needs to contain search form
- Show a list of Cocktails
- Clicking on a result should take the user to the details page for the drink.

### Objectives for VG (_Doesn't translate to Very Good but for all intents an purposes it works here_)

## Search page ++

- In addition to name, the ability to search for Category, Ingredients and glass type.
- Appropriate validation.
- Paginated results, Maximum 10 results per page.

## Favorites page

- The ability to save your favorite cocktails.
- When a random cocktail or search result is shown, the user should be able to tell if it is already a favorite or not.
- The user should be able to edit their favorites.
- Favorites should be saved in localStorage so the user will still have them when they return to the app after a while.
- Navbar needs to be updated to accommodate the new favorites page.

# Styling

Styling on this project was optional, if we wanted to we could turn in an ugly html mess, but common, nobody wants to do that.
